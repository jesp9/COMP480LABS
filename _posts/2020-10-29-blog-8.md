In this blog, we will discuss how to install security onion into a VM! This was an assignment for my Computer Security class and we'll go through the steps on how I installed it.

Firstly, let's download an .iso file of SecurityOnion but in this case, a secured version was already provided for me. The version was `securityonion-16.04.7.1.iso`

Next, setup a VM accordingly:
  - 4GB of DRAM and
  - at least 20GB of hard drive (dynamically allocated)
Use the .iso file to install securityonion in the vm, click 'setup' from the desktop and let the installer do its thing.

After installing, we will run the command `sudo soup` in the terminal (which will update your SecurityOnion installation).

At the top of your virtual machine window, select:
  - Devices -> Insert Guest Additions CD image ->
   - Click 'Run'
After the system reboots, when the system asks which network to use, we will pick DHCP.

Setup the username and passwords as needed.

Finally, click “yes, proceed with the changes” until you receive a
series of message boxes telling you about logs, PulledPork, Snort
tools, etc.

After taking all the necessary steps, this is how your desktop will look:
