This first blog I will be doing is a simple but technical one. "What to do when your brand new hard drive won't show up on your mac?" Meaning hard drive is not popping up on your desktop. The reason why I picked this topic is that my friend (who is not so technically inclined) bought a new hard drive but for an odd reason, her drive is unuseable.

Here's how I was able to "locate" and reformat her drive so it can be recognized normally by her mac:

1. Check Under Disk Utility. 

   Any drives will show up under disk utility, next is to select that drive that is having problems and run either 'first aid' to find what the problem is and fix      it.

   In my case, I didn't use 'first aid' as I knew it needed reformatting and that is what I did. After formatting, her drive was fixed and ran as intended.
