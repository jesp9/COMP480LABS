In this blog, I will discuss how to add "font icons" such as twitter or github icons into your html/css file.

First step is to setup an account fontawesome and acquire a kit. We need to acquire a kit in order to integrate the code from fontawesome.com

Here is how it will look in code:

We will put this line of code inside of our html footer.

`<head>
        <script defer src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/cf9a8e9ec8.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
        </head>`

After, pick an icon from fontawesome.com that you would like use, in this blog I picked the github icon.

This is how the line of code from fontawesome will look like: `<i class="fab fa-github"></i>` we will insert this line where we would like in our html footer, in this instance, next to "GitHub"

Here is how the 'font icon' will look including the line of code previously mentioned:
