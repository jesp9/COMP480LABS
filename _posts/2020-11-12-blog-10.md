In this blog I will discuss how to use AWS Infrastructures such as EC2s and S3 Buckets after implementing these, we will create IAM Roles and S3 Policies.

After creating IAM Roles, we will attach them to the EC2 Instance. Then finally, install the AWS CLI (Command-Line Interface.)

The initial step is to setup our EC2 Instance. In order to do that, we will go to EC2 > Instances, then click "Launch Instance"
