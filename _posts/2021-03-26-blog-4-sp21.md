In this blog, we will go through how to make a VPC with Public and Private Subnets in AWS.

First step is to launch your AWS Console and go over to the VPC tab. After clicking, select the "Launch VPC Wizard." This will redirect us over to configure our VPC.

Next, select "VPC with Public and Private Subnets." 

Step 2, leave IPv4 CIDR Block as is, and name your VPC. For your public subnet, CIDR can also be left alone. Availibility zones are for your preference and can be left alone.

Finally, select an Elastic IP Allocation ID and hit "create vpc" and we are done.
