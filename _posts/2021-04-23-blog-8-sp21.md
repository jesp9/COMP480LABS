In this blog, we will go through a few steps on how to setup a lambda function on AWS. This function is what I used for my COVID-19 data scraper for vaccines.

Firstly, go over to AWS Lambda and click create function.

Second, name the function, pick which runtime you want, then pick an a role. In this case, I used an existing role to use to put the data into named lambda-s3-role.

Finally, click create function.
