In this blog, we'll discuss how to use netcat and setup two virtual machines to talk to each other.

Firstly, we'll setup two virtual machines with 2GB Ram and 10 GB of hard drive running Ubuntu LTS 18.04. 

  - Keep the setup basic, host and user can be anything
  - Can use guided partitioning and set up LVM
  - No need for HTTP proxy (can leave blank)
  - No automatic updates are necessary
  - No software packages need to be installed (keep it basic!)
  - Can install GRUB boot loader to master boot record
  
On each VM, run:
  - apt-get install netcat
  - sudo update-alternatives --config nc
Put each VM on the Host-Only Adapter network, then to make them communicate:
  - On the first VM, execute `nc -nlvp 4444`
  - On the second VM, execute `nc -nv ip.addr.of.second.vm 4444`
  
Now, the two VMs are connected to each other and are listening to each other.
