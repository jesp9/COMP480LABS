Hi ! Welcome to my first ever blog.

In this blog, we will talk about installing homebrew, ruby, as well as jekyll. We will also learn to create our blogs and pushing files into github on macOS operating systems.

Here are the steps:

We will be installing homebrew which is a free and open-source software package management system that simplifies the installation of software on macOS operating system.
Go to your terminal or preferred text editor and under terminal type the following commands:

$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

This command will install homebrew on your computer. We will need homebrew to install and upgrade ruby.

Next, run:

$ brew install ruby and $brew upgrade ruby

The next step is to run the command "$ gem install jekyll" unfortunately, my system had some errors that would not let me install jekyll.
To work around the errors, I found a solution via the comment section of a youtube tutorial on how to install jekyll on mac.

Here is the workaround:

First, we will echo the path to our bash profile.

$ echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
then type:
$ source ~/.bash_profile

Now, we are able to install jekyll.

$ sudo gem install -n /usr/local/bin/ jekyll

We will need to sudo and install in /usr/local/bin to bypass permission on mac.
Congratulations ! Jekyll is now installed in your system.

Run $ jekyll -v to check if jekyll is installed correctly and to check the version.

Now it's time to setup our very first blog!

$ jekyll new <blog name> (you can choose what name you want here)

Our blog is not setup, now we need to cd into our blog and serve it.

$ cd <blog name>
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
  
Finally, we have our first blog running. In order to view our blog, we need to navigate to the localhost: http://127.0.0.1:4000/ from there we can see our posts.
