In this blog, we will discuss some javascript functions I used for my Web Development class!

In my Web Development class, the project required us to use our knowledge of html, css and javascript including some knowledge of js libraries. 
Using all of these, we were required to make a giga pet that has information regarding name, weight, happiness, and our action of choice of the pet. 
These values (happiness, weight, action of choice) changes when each one of the four buttons are pressed. The three buttons are pre-provided by the prompt which are called 'treat', 'play', and 'exercise.'
