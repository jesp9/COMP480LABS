In this blog, we will discuss some javascript functions I used for my Web Development class!

In my Web Development class, the project required us to use our knowledge of html, css and javascript including some knowledge of js libraries. 

Using all of these, we were required to make a giga pet that has information regarding name, weight, happiness, and our action of choice of the pet. 

These values (happiness, weight, action of choice) changes when each one of the four buttons are pressed. The three buttons are pre-provided by the prompt which are called 'treat', 'play', and 'exercise.' Since another action has to be added, another button has to be added. I named the 4th button "pet" and when the button is clicked, the pet would bark.

Since we will be discussing how functions in javascript are used in this project, let's dive in. In order to make the buttons work, I created a functions for each button accotdingly that would react when it is pressed.

First button is 'treat' this button would increase pet weight and increase pet happiness at the same time as shown below:

Second button is 'play' this button would increase pet happiness but would decrease weight as shown below:

Third button is 'exercise' this button would decrease happiness and at the same time decrease pet weight as shown below:

Fourth button is 'pet' this button is different from the original buttons as this would just only increase pet barks as shown below:

In the page this is how all the buttons look like:
