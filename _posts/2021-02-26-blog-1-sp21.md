In this blog I will discuss how to create an AWS Infrastructure, EC2 Instance. This walkthrough is just a basic implementation in order to showcase using AWS and its many useful features.

The initial step is to setup our EC2 Instance. In order to do that, we will go to EC2 > Instances, then click "Launch Instance".

In setting up an EC2 Instance there are 6 steps:

1. Choose your AMI (Amazon Machine Image):

- In this walkthrough, I used Ubuntu 20.04 as instructed.

2. Choose Instance type:

- As I only had a free tier, I left this as default.

3. Choose Instance Details:

- Also left this configuration default, but made sure 'Auto-assign Public IP' `enabled`.

4. Add Storage:

6. Configure Security Group

- This configuration is important as if we leave it as default, anyone can access the instance. In this case, I configured it in a way that we have to ssh into the instance using the school provided VPN.
