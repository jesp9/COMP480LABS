Today I will be talking about Structuring HTML pages. Specifically how structural tags like aside, article, nav, and section are being used. Also including, semantic tags such as headers, footers, etc.

We'll start with `<aside>` tag, aside is used to emphasize a piece of information for the viewer to see. It highlights the text in a box form to differentiate from normal text.
1. `<aside>` tag is used as shown below.

and here is how it will show on the webpage:

2. `<article>` tag is used to section out independent, self-contained content. Here is how it looks:

3. `<nav>` tag is used to define a set of navigation links. Here is how it looks:

4. `<section>` tag is used to define a section in a document. section tag is a straightforward tag is it's only purpose is to make the html code neater. Here is how it looks:

Now moving on to semantic tags, header and footer.

1. `<header>` This element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.

A `<header>` element typically contains:

- one or more heading elements (h1 - h6)
- logo or icon
- authorship information

Here is how it looks:

2. `<footer>` Finally our last semantic tag, this tag defines a footer for a document or section.

A `<footer>` element typically contains: 

- authorship information
- copyright information
- contact information
- sitemap
- back to top links
- related documents

Here's how it looks:

There are a lot more very important html tags to learn but these are the foundation of html coding that we should learn.
