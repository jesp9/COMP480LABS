Hi !

In this blog, we will talk about installing ruby, homebrew and, jekyll and pushing files into github on a macOS computer.

Here are the steps:

Go to your terminal or preferred text editor and under terminal type the following commands:

$ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

This command will install homebrew on your computer. We will need homebrew to install and upgrade ruby.

Next, run:

$brew install ruby and $brew upgrade ruby
