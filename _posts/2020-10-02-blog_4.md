In this blog we will talk about a previous project I finished for my Web Development class, regarding making my very own website using only HTML and CSS.
The goal for this project was to demonstrate basic knowledge with HTML and CSS. For this project, we were given instructions to make a website about what interests us in our lives. So for my project, I wanted to showcase my pride and joy; my project car.

Here are screenshots of the code for the 4 HTML webpage file and 1 CSS file that was required:

Here you can see my main page, what I wanted for this webpage were links to the other pages so I've included navigation links on top of every page:
