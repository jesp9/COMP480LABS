Blog 7 will be about how to crack passwords using 'Johnny' in a Kali Linux VM. We'll use /etc/shadow file as our target.

-	Johnny is easy to use as you would only create a .txt file copying over the contents of /etc/shadow and let the application run.
-	First, run: `$cat /etc/shadow >> Desktop/crack`
-	This command will output the contents of /etc/shadow to a new file called ‘crack’
- After making the text file, open it using ‘open password file’ and then click ‘start new attack’
-	After running, the password should appear next to username as circled below:

-	Only one password was able to be cracked which was my login to the kali system.
-	The process took about <2 seconds
