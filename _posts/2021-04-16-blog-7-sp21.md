In this blog, I will show steps on how to make a Load Balancer on your AWS EC2 Instance.

First step in to click over to 'EC2' and scroll down to the bottom of the page to locate the button "Load Balancers"

Next, now we are on the page for Load Balancers. Click "Create Load Balancer" to get started. Here is how it should look:

Then, hit "Create" on "Classic Load Balancer"

The next step, create a name for your balancer, for "create lb inside" depends on the vpc you are working on. Next, subnets. This also depends on your application if you need it or not, configure on what is needed.

Next, security groups. This also depends on your application.

For health check, it is good to put "response timeout" to 3 seconds and "interval" to 10 seconds in order for the balancers to check the application more frequently.

Finally, attach to the EC2 you are working on and hit "create" to finish.
